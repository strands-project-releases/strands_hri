Package Description
=====================
This package contains simple human following

The main function of this package is making the robot follow humans based on
the information from passive people detection.

The State Machine inside the package contains:

  Start stage - Wandering stage - Following stage - Local-searching stage
  
Getting Start
=========================
Before you can launch this package, you need:
    
    roscore
    strands robot bringup 
    strands robot camera
    strands ui
    strands navigation
    perception people tracker
    
To start this module, simply launch:
    
    roslaunch strands_human_following simple_follow.launch [wandering_mode, config_file]
    rosrun strands_human_following simple_follow_client.py
    
There are two parameters that can be changed:
* wandering_mode [wait, normal] with wait as default
* config_file where the configuration of this module is stored. It is stored in /strands_hri/strands_human_following/conf/default.yaml by default

Configurations
==========================
To change the settings of this package, find:
    
    /strands_hri/strands_human_following/conf/default.yaml
    
Parameters you can change are listed below:

    wander_area            : (polygon)
    follow_area            : (polygon)
    max_t_frames(tolerence): (int)
    alpha                  : (double)
    distance(safe distance): (double)

Wander area is the area where the robot will wander around when there is no
person detected. Follow area is the area where the robot will follow a person;
The robot will not follow outside the follow area even when there are persons
detected. Both wander area and follow area are polygon which are defined by
points [x,y].

Max_t_frames is the maximum frames where the robot searches a person after it
loses the person. Alpha is the factor of how far the pan tilt unit rotates when the robot follows a person. Distance is the distance between the robot and a person when the robot follows the person. 
    
Tasks and Routines
============================   
There is an example called routine_example.py of how to create a task and add
it to scheduler. First of all,

    roslaunch task_executor task-scheduler.launch

must be up and running. Create the task as follows:

```
task = Task(start_node_id=[WayPoint], max_duration=[DurationOfTheTask], action='simple_follow')

task_utils.add_int_argument(task, [DurationOfHumanFollowing])
```

Task_utils is needed since SimpleFollow.action has one integer argument to
determine how long the human following runs.

Problems
============================

Can not catch up with human's normal pace.

Can not follow when people walk towards or pass by the robot.
