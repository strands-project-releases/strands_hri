# Strands gazing package
Since gazing is one important part of human-robot interaction this package will provide general applications to perform 
gazing behaviours.

## Gaze at pose
This node takes a given `geometry_msgs/PoseStamped` and moves the head to gaze at this position. This is 
implemented as an action server.

### Parameters
* `head_pose` _Default: /head/commanded_state_: The topic to which the joint state messages for the head position are 
published.
* `head_frame` _Default: /head_base_frame_: The target coordinate frame.

### Running
```
rosrun strands_gazing gaze_at_pose [_parameter:=value]
```
To start the actual gazing you have to use the actionlib client architecture, 
e.g. `rosrun actionlib axclient.py /gaze_at_pose`
* goal
 * `int32 runtime_sec`: The time the gazing should be executed in seconds. Set to 0 for infinit run time (has to be 
cancelled to stop). _Cancelling a goal will trigger the head to move to the zero position._
 * `topic_name`: The name of the topic on which to listen for the poses. Currently: `/move_base/current_goal` and `/upper_body_detector/closest_bounding_box_centre` but really everything that poblishes a stamped pose can be used.
* result
 * `bool expired`: true if run time is up, false if cancelled.
* feedback
 * `float32 remaining_time`: The remaining run time.
 * `geometry_msgs/Pose target`: The pose at which the robot currently gazes.

### Notes
Since some of the topics that publish a PoseStamped do this only once, e.g. `/move_base/current_goal`, the transformation runs a infinite loop. This means that move_base publishes the pose once and inside the look the transform will run for the updated robot position with the received pose from move_base. As soon as a new pose is received the transformloop will use this one to calculate the transform. This still runs in real time but accounts for nodes that are lazy publishers.
